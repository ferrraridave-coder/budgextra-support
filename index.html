<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is Budgextra?</h3>
<p>
    Budgextra is a privacy-focused budgeting app for iPhone and iPad. It helps you track monthly bills,
    expenses, and income with a clean, intuitive interface. Your data is stored locally on your device and,
    if iCloud sync is enabled, it can also sync and back up across your devices using Apple’s iCloud (CloudKit).
</p>

<h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
<p>
    No account is required. Budgextra works entirely on your device. iCloud sync is enabled by default —
    if you are signed in to iCloud, your data will automatically sync and back up across your Apple devices
    using CloudKit. You can disable iCloud sync at any time in Settings if you prefer to keep everything on-device only.
</p>

<h3>How do I add bills, income, and expenses?</h3>
<p>
    Tap the <strong>Add</strong> button at the bottom of the main screen to add a bill, income, or expense.
    Bills are recurring monthly items with a due date. Income is your monthly pay or earnings.
    Expenses are one-off purchases or payments.
</p>

<h3>How do I mark bills as paid?</h3>
<p>
    Tap any unpaid bill to select it — the card will highlight green. You can select multiple bills.
    Then tap the tick button to confirm them as paid for the current month.
</p>

<h3>How do I edit or delete items?</h3>
<p>
    Long-press any bill or expense to see options to edit or delete it. You can also long-press the
    <strong>Current Balance</strong> box to manually adjust your balance.
</p>

<h3>What is the overdraft feature?</h3>
<p>
    In Settings, you can enable an overdraft and set your overdraft limit. When your balance goes negative,
    the app will show how much of your overdraft remains. If you exceed your overdraft limit, the app displays
    your actual negative balance.
</p>

<h3>Does the balance carry over between months?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. Any remaining balance from previous months automatically carries forward to the next month.
    For example, if you have £500 left at the end of January and receive £2,500 income in February,
    your February balance starts at £3,000.
</p>

<h3>How is my data handled?</h3>
<p>
    All your financial data is stored locally on your device.
</p>
<p>
    iCloud sync (CloudKit) is enabled by default — if you are signed in to iCloud, your data is also synced and backed up
    to your private iCloud account. You can disable iCloud sync in Settings if you prefer to keep your data on-device only.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> If iCloud sync is disabled and you uninstall the app or lose your device, your data may be permanently lost.
    Budgextra never sends your data to third-party servers. No one has access to your data except you.
    For full details, see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h3>Can I use the app offline?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. Budgextra works fully offline. All data is stored locally on your device. If iCloud sync is enabled,
    syncing will occur automatically when an internet connection is available.
</p>

<h3>What is Face ID used for?</h3>
<p>
    You can optionally enable Face ID in Settings to protect access to your financial data.
    When enabled, Face ID is required each time you open the app.
</p>

<h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
<p>
    Budgextra supports iPhone and iPad running iOS/iPadOS 18.0 or later.
</p>

<h3>How do I report a bug?</h3>

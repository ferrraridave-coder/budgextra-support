<h1>Budgextra — Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<p>
    Budgextra ("the App") is developed by David Picknell. This Privacy Policy explains how your
    data is handled when you use Budgextra on iPhone, iPad & Mac.
</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external
    servers. All your financial data — including bills, income, expenses, balance adjustments,
    and settings — is stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>iCloud (CloudKit) Sync</h2>

<p>
    If you are signed in to iCloud on your device, Budgextra uses Apple's CloudKit to sync your
    data across your Apple devices. This data is stored in your <strong>private iCloud
    account</strong> and is not accessible to the developer or any third party. Apple's iCloud
    is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>

<p>
    All data is saved locally on your device using JSON files stored in the app's sandboxed
    container. This data persists between app launches and is not shared with any external service.
</p>

<h2>Face ID</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra offers an optional Face ID lock to protect access to your financial data. Face ID
    authentication is handled entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework on your device.
    No biometric data is accessed, stored, or transmitted by the App.
</p>

<h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, tracking, advertising frameworks, or
    third-party SDKs. No usage data, crash reports, or behavioural data is collected by the
    developer.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does <strong>not</strong> integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or
    advertising networks. The only external service used is Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) for
    optional cross-device sync.
</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The App does not
    require any account creation or personal data entry beyond your own financial records stored
    locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this
    page with an updated date.
</p>

<h1>Budgextra — Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<p>
    Budgextra ("the App") is developed by <strong>David Picknell</strong>.
    This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use Budgextra on iPhone and iPad.
</p>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Privacy first:</strong> Budgextra does not collect, track, or transmit your data.
    Your financial information stays on your device and in your private iCloud account (if enabled).
</div>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.
    All financial data — including bills, income, expenses, balances, and settings —
    is stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>iCloud (CloudKit) Sync & Backup</h2>

<p>
    iCloud sync is <strong>enabled by default</strong>.
    If you are signed in to iCloud, Budgextra will automatically sync and back up your data
    across your Apple devices using Apple’s CloudKit service.
</p>

<p>
    This data is stored in your <strong>private iCloud account</strong> and is not accessible
    to the developer or any third party.
</p>

<p>
    You can disable iCloud sync at any time in the App’s Settings if you prefer to keep your data
    on-device only.
</p>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Important:</strong> If iCloud sync is disabled and you uninstall the App
    or lose your device, your data will be permanently lost and cannot be recovered.
</div>

<p>
    Apple’s handling of iCloud data is governed by
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>

<p>
    All data is stored locally within the App’s sandboxed storage on your device.
    Budgextra does not upload or share your data with any external services.
</p>

<h2>Face ID</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra offers an optional Face ID lock to protect access to your financial data.
    Face ID authentication is handled entirely by Apple’s system frameworks.
</p>

<p>
    Budgextra does not access, store, or transmit any biometric information.
</p>

<h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does <strong>not</strong> use analytics, tracking technologies,
    advertising frameworks, or third-party SDKs.
</p>

<p>
    No usage data, behavioural data, or crash analytics are collected by the developer.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does <strong>not</strong> integrate with third-party services, APIs,
    financial institutions, or advertising networks.
</p>

<p>
    The only external service used is Apple’s iCloud (CloudKit) for optional
    cross-device sync and backup.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
    Budgextra does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    The App does not require accounts, logins, or personal identification.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
    Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
</p>
